**Sacrament of Reconciliation in this Jubilee of Mercy**(Catholic News Agency: http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/the-year-of-mercy-whats-it-all-about-41675/)

"The Holy Father wants the Jubilee of Mercy to be an
opportunity to place the sacrament of God's mercy - which is the sacrament of
penance and reconciliation - into the central pastoral life for the Church. We
know that, unfortunately, Catholics don't take advantage of the sacrament as
much as they should, and so this is an opportunity for us to remind people of
God's desire to forgive us and that he's always there to forgive us no matter
the sin."
